# Welcome to the Azure Optimization Engine - now a FinOps Toolkit tool! üîç

üëã Thank you for your interest in the Azure Optimization Engine! We've migrated the Azure Optimization Engine repository to a new home - the Microsoft [FinOps Toolkit](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine). For historical reasons, the older code will remain here, but the most recent version and new releases will be made in the FinOps Toolkit repository going forward. Here's what you need to know:

1. **We are collecting feedback in preparation for AOE v2**: Answer this [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.office.com/r/fLeJS8Rd2E) and contribute to the [discussion about the evolution of AOE](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/discussions/753).

1. **Start Using the FinOps Toolkit**: If you were using the Azure Optimization Engine, it's time to switch! The [FinOps Toolkit](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine) provides advanced solutions, automation scripts, and learning resources to accelerate your FinOps journey.

2. **Open Issues Here**: Have questions, feedback, or need assistance? Open an issue in the [FinOps Toolkit repository](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues), and our community and maintainers will be happy to help. üôå
